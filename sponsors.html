      <p>This years conference is bigger, badder and better.  For the first time, we're accepting sponsorship to help us give our delegates a little something extra.</p>
      <p>Selling tickets pays for the venue and lunch.  Sponsorship helps with all the cooler, more interesting stuff like T-shirts, a conference dinner, and that all-important conference staple - MORE COFFEE.</p>
      <p>If your company would be interested in supporting NSScotland (and the caffeine or wardrobe needs of Cocoa developers from across the UK, Europe and North America) please  <a href="mailto:sponsorship@nsscotland.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
