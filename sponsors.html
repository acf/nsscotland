      <p>This years conference is bigger, badder and better.  For the first time, we're accepting sponsorship to help us give our delegates a little something extra.</p>
      <p>Selling tickets pays for the venue and lunch.  Sponsorship helps with all the cooler, more interesting stuff like T-shirts, a conference dinner, and that all-important conference staple - MORE COFFEE.</p>
      <p>If your company would be interested in supporting NSScotland (and the caffeine or wardrobe needs of Cocoa developers from across the UK, Europe and North America) please  <a href="mailto:sponsorship@nsscotland.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

	      <p>In November 2009, PayPal opened its global payments platform to third-party developers, ushering in a new generation of innovative payments. PayPal is the world’s first truly open global online payment platform – giving developers access to its global payment engine built over the last decade with more than 110 million active PayPal accounts available in 190 markets and 25 currencies. The PayPal Developer Network puts developers in the driver’s seat, providing the resources and the tools needed to change the future of payments – from mobile apps to web apps and social networks. Developers can now monetize their ideas and tap into the $30 trillion global payments opportunity – the next wave of payments innovation is now in their hands.</p>
