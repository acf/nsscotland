        <h3>Steven Baker</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://stevenrbaker.com">stevenrbaker.com</a></h4>
        <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
        Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>

        she set up the Hackspace in Brighton, BuildBrighton.</p>

        <p>Rob writes <a href="https://github.com/robrix">code (compulsively)</a>
         and <a href="http://antitypical.com/writing">prose (cathartically)</a> and <a href="http://intersections.tumblr.com/">terrible

        <h4><a href="http://sicpers.info/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programmers</a></h4>
        <p>Graham is a mobile app developer and security boffin for at Facebook in London. He is the author of Test-Driven iOS Development, Professional Cocoa Application Security and APPropriate Behaviour.</p>
        <h4>Testing an iOS App From One End to the Other</h4>
        <p>As we seek to reliably release our apps frequently, regularly and at high quality, we need to be constantly aware of the state of our products and to be informed
        quickly of any problems.  In this talk, Graham describes how end-to-end tests fit into Facebook's iOS app engineering, the problems they uncover and the challenges they solve - and introduce.</p>

        <h3>Eric Knapp</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://madisoncollege.edu">Madison Area Technical College</a></h4>
        <p>Eric is a faculty member at Madison College in Madison, Wisconsin, USA.  He teaches iOS 
        development with a little Java on the side.  Before venturing into the world of programming, 
        he had careers as a high school teacher and a cabinetmaker.  Eric has learned and forgotten a 
        lot of programming langages in his long career.  He has fond memories of most of them, including
         COBOL, which paid for his first Mac in 1986. The journey from COBOL to Swift has been 
         welcome and rewarding.</p>
        <p>Previously a professional musician, he is now an avid amateur playing the Chapman Stick.  Audio
         and MIDI programming for iOS brought many of his lifelong interests together into one small package.</p>

        <h3>Sally Shepard</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://www.dennis.co.uk">Dennis Publishing</a></h4>
        <p>Sally initially decided to study audio out of a love of music and tinkering with expensive hardware. Not satisfied 
        with one degree in audio engineering, she embarked on a second, where she continued her weird obsession with microphones. 
        She started working at the Apple Store the week the first iPhone launched, and immediately knew it was time to 
        switch tracks and get a third degree. After completing a Masters in Software Engineering, she started working as an iOS 
        developer at a digital agency, producing bespoke apps for well-known clients.</p>
		<p>She currently works in London, where she is Head of App Development at Dennis Publishing, one of the world’s leading
		 independent publishers. In her spare time she enjoys hacking, playing banjo and taking pictures with vintage cameras.</p>

        <h3>Drew McCormack</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://mentalfaculty.com/">The Mental Faculty</a></h4>
        <p>After 15 years as a Theoretical Chemist, I developed an interest in Mac and iOS app development, and I'm now judge, jury, and executioner 
        at The Mental Faculty B.V.  Most of my working hours are spent dodging accountants and lawyers, and developing our flagship product,
         <a href="http://mentalcaseapp.com">Mental Case</a>. I've written articles for the Apple Developer Connection, and co-authored the book
          'Beginning Mac OS X Snow Leopard Programming'. Teaching <a href="http://cmm.nl">app development courses at CMM</a> in Amsterdam keeps my knowledge 
          fresh, and I've had involvements with MacResearch.org (board member/contributor) and the Core Plot project (founder/contributor). The past 
          year of my life has been made a hell by iCloud.</p>
           <h4>Technically Magic</h4>
        <p>App development and magic have a lot in common, and I'm not referring to the your-interface-should-feel-like-magic-and-delight-the-user kinda way.
        App development and magic both rely on technologies the audience is unaware of to achieve seemingly impossible feats.  Displaying a steady stream of
        photos from a collection a hundred thousand strong on an underpowered iPod touch is arguably as impressive as the proverbial rabbit from the hat.  In 
        this talk, Drew will look at  some of his favourite tricks.  How do you make devices seem capable of greater performance than should be possible?
        How do you make them respond to events they should not be aware of?  This talk will break the Magicians...er...developers code.</p>

        <h3>Mike Abdullah</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://www.karelia.com/">Karelia</a></h4>

        <p>Mike Abdullah "found" Karelia while studying for a Master's degree 
        in Integrated Engineering. Hired on originally to write documentation 
        for Sandvox 1.2, Mike joined Karelia full-time shortly after 
        graduation. Completely unbeknownst to Dan or Terrence at the time, Mike 
        was and is a spectacular Cocoa developer.</p>

        <p>Quickly moving up through the ranks, Mike is now technical lead for 
        Sandvox and manages <a href="https://github.com/karelia">Karelia's open source repositories</a> on GitHub.</p>

        <p>When not coding, Mike can often be found rock climbing or karting. He 
        is also an accomplished musician, playing both trumpet and percussion 
        for notable garage bands and orchestras around London.</p>

        <p>Mike holds a Master's in Integrated Engineering with honors 
        from the University of Reading.</p>
