      <h3>Dave Addey</h3>
      <h4>For Your UIs Only</h4>
        <p>Apple's Human Interface Guidelines give an excellent overview of when and where to use many of the UIKit controls. 
        However, it's not always clear-cut as to which UIKit approach you should use, or when one control is more 
        appropriate than another. This talk will build on the fact that the Guidelines are exactly that - guidelines - 
        and will help you decide when it's time to expand on the guidelines' recommendations to suit your UI's needs.</p>

      <h3>Steven Baker</h3>
      <h4>Test-Driving Cocoa Applications</h4>
        <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
        Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>

      <h3>Matt Gemmell</h3>
      <h4>You can use it with your eyes closed</h4>
      <p>Stevie Wonder said "There's nothing on the iPhone or the iPad that you can do that I can't do", and it's true. iOS is one of the most accessible platforms for people with visual impairments, but comparatively few sighted developers are aware of just how blind people can even use a touch-screen device. In this talk, I'll give an overview of VoiceOver on iOS, demonstrate how it's used, and show just how easy it is to support accessibility in your own apps.</p>

        <h3>Neil Inglis</h3>
        <h4>Making Friends with NSDocument and UIDocument </h4>
        <p>Neil will explain how to harness the power of NSDocument/UIDocument to make your life as a developer easier and make sure that your document based applications include 
        all the document features that users expect. He'll take an in-depth look into undo support, autosave, versioning, supporting iCloud 
        and how to utilise the lower level write APIs to create flexible, cross platform document formats.  </p>

      <h3>Graham Lee </h3>
      <h4>Architectural Patterns for Wetware Systems </h4>
      <p>Graham investigates common techniques for working with processors that feature lossy, non-random access storage; aggressive pre-emptive context switching; and a wide library of fuzzy pattern-based logic and illogic functions.  </p>

      <h3>Jamie Montgomerie </h3>
      <h4>Virtually Understanding Memory</h4>
      <p>The Mac and iOS memory system is much misunderstood. Jamie will explain how it works, and what all those stats mean - virtually all of them, at least. He will slay some myths, show some interesting tools, and give tips explaining how you can use the virtual memory system in your own Mac and iOS apps.  </p>

      <h3>Matt Farrugia</h3>
      <h4>How to get hired by Black Pixel</h4>
      <p> Daniel Pasco wrote about the interview questions Black Pixel use as a litmus test for senior iOS developers. But how does a novice developer get to that point? You need a plan, and Matt will show you one. What the key frameworks and technologies are; how a senior developer needs to behave; and why these things are important.  </p>

        <h3>Lori Olson</h3>
        <h4>Core Data in Motion</h4>
        <p>Have you tried to use CoreData in RubyMotion, only to get lost in the quagmire of simplistic or confusing examples, DSL's and gems? Have you been asking yourself these questions: 
         Do I have to use XCode to create a CoreData model?; How do relationships work in code work anyway?; How do I pre-load data into my CoreData store?; What is an NSFetchedResultsController, and why do I need one?</p>
        <p>We'll delve into each of these questions, and review the surprisingly simple, elegant solutions that RubyMotion can provide.</p>

      <h3>Gordon Murrison</h3>
      <h4>Core Audio</h4>
      <p>Core Audio is the most comprehensive and powerful audio programming framework ever created and it's built into OS X and iOS. In this talk we'll explore this low-level C-based world and take a look at the technologies that power apps like GarageBand and Logic. We'll also delve into some of the APIs in more detail to see how, where and when they can be used.  </p>

      <h4>Seeing the Bigger Picture</h4>
      <p>Mirroring your application's user interface to a second screen can be useful. Creating a bespoke second window is liberating. This talk will provide you with an overview of how you can take advantage of a second display and give you some examples of what you can do with one.  </p>
