    <h4>Testing an iOS app from one end to the other</h4>
    <p>As we seek to reliably release our apps frequently, regularly and at high quality, we need to be constantly aware of the state of our products and to be informed
    quickly of any problems.  In this talk, Graham describes how end-to-end tests fit into Facebook's iOS app engineering, the problems they uncover and the challenges they solve - and introduce.</p>

    <h4>Technically Magic</h4>
    <p>App development and magic have a lot in common, and I'm not referring to the your-interface-should-feel-like-magic-and-delight-the-user kinda way.
    App development and magic both rely on technologies the audience is unaware of to achieve seemingly impossible feats.  Displaying a steady stream of
    photos from a collection a hundred thousand strong on an underpowered iPod touch is arguably as impressive as the proverbial rabbit from the hat.  In 
    this talk, Drew will look at  some of his favourite tricks.  How do you make devices seem capable of greater performance than should be possible?
    How do you make them respond to events they should not be aware of?  This talk will break the Magicians...er...developers code.</p>

      <h3>Drew McCormack</h3>
      <h4><a href="http://mentalfaculty.com/">The Mental Faculty</a></h4>
      <p>After 15 years as a Theoretical Chemist, I developed an interest in Mac and iOS app development, and I'm now judge, jury, and executioner 
      at The Mental Faculty B.V.  Most of my working hours are spent dodging accountants and lawyers, and developing our flagship product,
      <a href="http://mentalcaseapp.com">Mental Case</a>. I've written articles for the Apple Developer Connection, and co-authored the book
      'Beginning Mac OS X Snow Leopard Programming'. Teaching <a href="http://cmm.nl">app development courses at CMM</a> in Amsterdam keeps my knowledge 
      fresh, and I've had involvements with MacResearch.org (board member/contributor) and the Core Plot project (founder/contributor). The past 
      year of my life has been made a hell by iCloud.</p>

    <h4>Many Types Make Light Work</h4>
    <p>Every programmer regularly faces the challenges of managing complexity and change.  Subclassing can help us 
   simplify, by sharing code and interfaces between related parts of our program.  But when requirements change out 
   from under our class hierarchy, unanticipated fragility can mean bugs, sweat and tears.  Swift offers us a better way.</p>

    <h4>How to be Indie and Still Keep Your Sanity</h4>
    <p>James has been writing his own apps for over twenty years, and will share his great wisdom 
    on how he's managed to be a successful indie developer without losing his mind. Actually, scratch 
    that last part - in truth, he lost it years ago, and this is nothing more than a cautionary tale on 
    where it all went wrong. Learn from his mistakes, learn well.</p>

      <p>James is a veteran of the Mac and iOS developer scene - he started working on his first app over twenty years 
      ago and it's still running today. Following a brief tour of duty at Apple where he worked on the Mac OS X Finder and 
      Dock, he has been working full time as an indie developer based in Glasgow, Scotland. He's currently best known for 
      his calculator app PCalc, and application dock DragThing.</p>

      <h3>Eric Knapp</h3>
      <h4><a href="http://madisoncollege.edu">Madison Area Technical College</a></h4>
      <p>Eric is a faculty member at Madison College in Madison, Wisconsin, USA.  He teaches iOS 
      development with a little Java on the side.  Before venturing into the world of programming, 
      he had careers as a high school teacher and a cabinetmaker.  Eric has learned and forgotten a 
      lot of programming langages in his long career.  He has fond memories of most of them, including
      COBOL, which paid for his first Mac in 1986. The journey from COBOL to Swift has been 
      welcome and rewarding.</p>
      <p>Previously a professional musician, he is now an avid amateur playing the Chapman Stick.  Audio
      and MIDI programming for iOS brought many of his lifelong interests together into one small package.</p>

      <h3>Sally Shepard</h3>
      <h4><a href="http://www.dennis.co.uk">Dennis Publishing</a></h4>
      <p>Sally initially decided to study audio out of a love of music and tinkering with expensive hardware. Not satisfied 
      with one degree in audio engineering, she embarked on a second, where she continued her weird obsession with microphones. 
      She started working at the Apple Store the week the first iPhone launched, and immediately knew it was time to 
      switch tracks and get a third degree. After completing a Masters in Software Engineering, she started working as an iOS 
      developer at a digital agency, producing bespoke apps for well-known clients.</p>
      <p>She currently works in London, where she is Head of App Development at Dennis Publishing, one of the world’s leading
      independent publishers. In her spare time she enjoys hacking, playing banjo and taking pictures with vintage cameras.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://stevenrbaker.com">stevenrbaker.com</a></h4>
      <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
      Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>
