      <h3>Steven Baker</h3>
      <h4><a href="http://stevenrbaker.com/">stevenrbaker.com</a></h4>
		<p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
      Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>

      <h3>Kate Ho</h3>
      <h4><a href="http://kateho.com/">kateho.com</a></h4>
<p>Most of my work has been in <strong>designing experiences for multitouch interfaces</strong>. In particular, interactive tables such as the Microsoft Surface and SMART Tables, plus the iPad. I&#8217;m excited about how multitouch can create more natural and intuitive ways of interacting with computers, as well as how they can help us <a href="http://www.inspireux.com/category/kathy-sierra/">be more awesome</a>. As part of my work at Interface3, we&#8217;ve won the <strong>RBS Touch Finance Competition</strong>, as well as<strong> SMART Technologies&#8217; Multitouch Competition</strong>. I seriously love what I do and will tell you at very opportunity if you let me.</p>
<p>I also started (with Jess, Thomas and Bela) <a href="http://www.startupcafe.co.uk">StartupCafe</a> &#8211; a blog focused on Edinburgh startup news. Our aim is to build an online place for the tech community. We have weekly events listings, we blog about startups and their founders, and we also have a lot of fun (check out our April Fools joke about our <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2010/04/01/startupcafe-opens-coffee-shop-in-george-square/">real cafe</a> and <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2011/04/01/looking-for-love-startupcafe-launches-startupdating/">startupdating</a>). StartupCafe has been featured on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/edinburgh/2011/mar/16/edinburgh-sxsw-startup-cafe">Guardian Edinburgh blog</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/bKmDfY">Guardian podcast</a>.</p>
<p>On top of this, I also started CompSoc (Edinburgh Uni Computer Society) back in 2000, Hoppers (women in Informatics) in 2006, and help out at <a href="http://www.girlgeekscotland.org.uk">Girl Geeks Scotland</a>.</p>      <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>

    <h4>Top Ten Tips for Building Apps with Maps</h4>
      <p>Location positioning technology, in a broad sense, has been around for ages. The potential applications—and complexity—multiply when you factor in the power of the mobile devices we all carry around. Working with location data can be tricky, with problems like difficulty testing and simulation, battery drain, imprecise data, and inaccurate representation. This talk will go through the lessons I’ve learned wrestling with different location-based projects and provide attendees with practical takeaways for building their own apps with maps.</p>

    <h4>Challenges Building a Swift Framework</h4>
      <p>Before Realm was even initially launched, Apple announced Swift. The team quickly realized how big this is going to be. So we fully committed in building a Swift version of the binding, which meant a lot of pioneering work to do. On that way a lot of new open tools were created and existing vastly extended and improved. But there are far more challenges involved in building a framework for Swift. This talk should summarize our experiences, point out pitfalls to avoid and give you some helpful hints on your way how to find a sweetspot for development in a fastly evolving ecosystem.</p>

    <h4>AppleScript for the 21st Century</h4>
      <p>Apple's ageing scripting architecture still provides a number of user benefits. Despite the current trend towards sandboxing and isolation, making applications work together can create powerful workflows to automate repetitive tasks. As a Mac developer, how do you facilitate that? Amy Worrall explores how Apple Events can still provide an expressive inter-process communication mechanism, and how scripting support needn't be scary.</p>
