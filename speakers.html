        <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
        Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>

        <h3>Drew McCormack</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://mentalfaculty.com/">The Mental Faculty</a></h4>
        <p>After 15 years as a Theoretical Chemist, I developed an interest in Mac and iOS app development, and I'm now judge, jury, and executioner 
        at The Mental Faculty B.V.  Most of my working hours are spent dodging accountants and lawyers, and developing our flagship product,
         <a href="http://mentalcaseapp.com">Mental Case</a>. I've written articles for the Apple Developer Connection, and co-authored the book
          'Beginning Mac OS X Snow Leopard Programming'. Teaching <a href="http://cmm.nl">app development courses at CMM</a> in Amsterdam keeps my knowledge 
          fresh, and I've had involvements with MacResearch.org (board member/contributor) and the Core Plot project (founder/contributor). The past 
          year of my life has been made a hell by iCloud.</p>

        <h3>Mike Abdullah</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://www.karelia.com/">Karelia</a></h4>
        <p>TBA</p>

        <p>Mike Abdullah "found" Karelia while studying for a Master's degree 
        in Integrated Engineering. Hired on originally to write documentation 
        for Sandvox 1.2, Mike joined Karelia full-time shortly after 
        graduation. Completely unbeknownst to Dan or Terrence at the time, Mike 
        was and is a spectacular Cocoa developer.</p>

        <p>Quickly moving up through the ranks, Mike is now technical lead for 
        Sandvox and manages <a href="https://github.com/karelia">Karelia's open source repositories</a> on GitHub.</p>

        <p>When not coding, Mike can often be found rock climbing or karting. He 
        is also an accomplished musician, playing both trumpet and percussion 
        for notable garage bands and orchestras around London.</p>

        <p>Mike holds a Master's in Integrated Engineering with honors 
        from the University of Reading.</p>
