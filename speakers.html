      <h4>For Your UIs Only</h4>
      <p>Apple's Human Interface Guidelines give an excellent overview of when and where to use many of the UIKit controls. 
      However, it's not always clear-cut as to which UIKit approach you should use, or when one control is more 
      appropriate than another. This talk will build on the fact that the Guidelines are exactly that - guidelines - 
      and will help you decide when it's time to expand on the guidelines' recommendations to suit your UI's needs.</p>

        <h3>Steven Baker</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://stevenrbaker.com">stevenrbaker.com</a></h4>
        <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
        Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>

      <h4>You can use it with your eyes closed</h4>
      <p>Stevie Wonder said "There's nothing on the iPhone or the iPad that you can do that I can't do", and it's true. iOS is one of the most accessible platforms for people with visual impairments, but comparatively few sighted developers are aware of just how blind people can even use a touch-screen device. In this talk, I'll give an overview of VoiceOver on iOS, demonstrate how it's used, and show just how easy it is to support accessibility in your own apps.</p>

        <h4>Making Friends with NSDocument and UIDocument </h4>
        <p>Neil will explain how to harness the power of NSDocument/UIDocument to make your life as a developer easier and make sure that your document based applications include 
        all the document features that users expect. He'll take an in-depth look into undo support, autosave, versioning, supporting iCloud 
        and how to utilise the lower level write APIs to create flexible, cross platform document formats.  </p>

        <p>Neil is a iOS and Mac developer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. After years of juggling Cocoa development with his day job Neil finally went indie in 2011. His most successful application to date is Sleeps to Christmas, a #1 ranked Top Free app which he is insistent on telling people was "just an experiment while he was learning" and that "he's really a much more serious programmer", something he'll aim to prove with his talk! More recently Neil has been working with MartianCraft on Briefs, a prototyping utility for Mac and iOS.</p>

        <p>Have you tried to use CoreData in RubyMotion, only to get lost in the quagmire of simplistic or confusing examples, DSL's and gems? Have you been asking yourself these questions: 
         Do I have to use XCode to create a CoreData model?; How do relationships work in code work anyway?; How do I pre-load data into my CoreData store?; What is an NSFetchedResultsController, and why do I need one?</p>
        <p>We'll delve into each of these questions, and review the surprisingly simple, elegant solutions that RubyMotion can provide.</p>
