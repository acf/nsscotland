        <h3>Steven Baker</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://stevenrbaker.com">stevenrbaker.com</a></h4>
        <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
        Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>
