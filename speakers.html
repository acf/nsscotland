      <h3>Steven Baker</h3>
      <h4><a href="http://stevenrbaker.com/">stevenrbaker.com</a></h4>
		<p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn't forgiven himself. 
      Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he's developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>

      <h3>Kate Ho</h3>
      <h4><a href="http://kateho.com/">kateho.com</a></h4>
<p>Most of my work has been in <strong>designing experiences for multitouch interfaces</strong>. In particular, interactive tables such as the Microsoft Surface and SMART Tables, plus the iPad. I&#8217;m excited about how multitouch can create more natural and intuitive ways of interacting with computers, as well as how they can help us <a href="http://www.inspireux.com/category/kathy-sierra/">be more awesome</a>. As part of my work at Interface3, we&#8217;ve won the <strong>RBS Touch Finance Competition</strong>, as well as<strong> SMART Technologies&#8217; Multitouch Competition</strong>. I seriously love what I do and will tell you at very opportunity if you let me.</p>
<p>I also started (with Jess, Thomas and Bela) <a href="http://www.startupcafe.co.uk">StartupCafe</a> &#8211; a blog focused on Edinburgh startup news. Our aim is to build an online place for the tech community. We have weekly events listings, we blog about startups and their founders, and we also have a lot of fun (check out our April Fools joke about our <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2010/04/01/startupcafe-opens-coffee-shop-in-george-square/">real cafe</a> and <a href="http://startupcafe.co.uk/2011/04/01/looking-for-love-startupcafe-launches-startupdating/">startupdating</a>). StartupCafe has been featured on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/edinburgh/2011/mar/16/edinburgh-sxsw-startup-cafe">Guardian Edinburgh blog</a> and the <a href="http://bit.ly/bKmDfY">Guardian podcast</a>.</p>
<p>On top of this, I also started CompSoc (Edinburgh Uni Computer Society) back in 2000, Hoppers (women in Informatics) in 2006, and help out at <a href="http://www.girlgeekscotland.org.uk">Girl Geeks Scotland</a>.</p>      <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
