  title: NSScotland 2013 - Speakers
---

<h2>Speakers</h2>
<h3>We are still looking for volunteers to talk for 40 minutes on Cocoa-related stuff - iOS or OSX</h3>
<p>I'm looking to do something a little different this year.  I'd like to structure the 2 day conference into 4 half-day 'modules', each containing 2 or 3 talks, that move from beginner to advanced. </p>
<p>My hope would be that all the talks are entertaining enough that everyone can get something out of them, this isn't a hard line between beginners day and advanced day.  I just want to provide some content early that helps more inexperienced folks get something from the later sessions.</p>
<p>If you'd like to speak, please mail me ( alancfrancis at nsscotland.com ) or hit me up on twitter ( @nsscotland )
 and we can talk about where you'd fit on a schedule like this.</p>

      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn’t forgiven himself. Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he’s developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>
