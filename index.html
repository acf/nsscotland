<h2>Speakers</h2>
<h2>We are not looking for speakers just now after a flood of offers.  Thanks! </h2>
<p>My hope would be that all the talks are entertaining enough that everyone can get something out of them, this isn't a hard line between beginners day and advanced day.  I just want to provide some content early that helps more inexperienced folks get something from the later sessions.</p>

      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p>In the third grade, Steven missed an opportunity to corner the Hockey Trivia video game market when he made such a huge mess of his software he had to rewrite it. As with most rewrites, it was a huge failure, and Steven still hasn’t forgiven himself. Since then, he has been obsessed with learning how to produce high quality software, and has been helping teams do just that. Along the way he’s developed tools, delivered talks, and yelled over pints about how to improve software.</p>

    <div class="abstract">
      <h4>You can use it with your eyes closed</h4>
      <p>Stevie Wonder said "There's nothing on the iPhone or the iPad that you can do that I can't do", and it's true. iOS is one of the most accessible platforms for people with visual impairments, but comparatively few sighted developers are aware of just how blind people can even use a touch-screen device. In this talk, I'll give an overview of VoiceOver on iOS, demonstrate how it's used, and show just how easy it is to support accessibility in your own apps.</p>

      <p>Have you tried to use CoreData in RubyMotion, only to get lost in the quagmire of simplistic or confusing examples, DSL's and gems?  Have you been asking yourself these questions:  Do I have to use XCode to create a CoreData model?; How do relationships work in code work anyway?; How do I pre-load data into my CoreData store?; What is an NSFetchedResultsController, and why do I need one?<p> 
      <p>We'll delve into each of these questions, and review the surprisingly simple, elegant solutions that RubyMotion can provide..</p>
