  title: NSScotland 2013 - Speakers
---

<h2>Speakers</h2>
<h3>We are still looking for volunteers to talk for 40 minutes on Cocoa-related stuff - iOS or OSX</h3>
<p>I'm looking to do something a little different this year.  I'd like to structure the 2 day conference into 4 half-day 'modules', each containing 2 or 3 talks, that move from beginner to advanced. </p>
<p>My hope would be that all the talks are entertaining enough that everyone can get something out of them, this isn't a hard line between beginners day and advanced day.  I just want to provide some content early that helps more inexperienced folks get something from the later sessions.</p>
<p>If you'd like to speak, please mail me ( alancfrancis at nsscotland.com ) or hit me up on twitter ( @nsscotland )
 and we can talk about where you'd fit on a schedule like this.</p>

      <h4>Core Audio</h4>
      <p>Core Audio is the most comprehensive and powerful audio programming framework ever created and it's built into OS X and iOS.  In this talk we'll explore this low-level C-based world and take a look at the technologies that power apps like GarageBand and Logic.  We'll also delve into some of the APIs in more detail to see how, where and when they can be used.</p>
