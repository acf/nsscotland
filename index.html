      <h4>ReactiveCocoa</h4>
      <p>Native apps spend a lot of time waiting and then reacting. We wait for the user to do something in the UI. Wait for a network call to respond. Wait for an asynchronous operation to complete. Wait for some dependent value to change. And then they react.</p>
      <p>But all those things—all that waiting and reacting—is usually handled in many disparate ways. That makes it hard for us to reason about them, chain them, or compose them in any uniform, high-level way. We can do better.</p>
      <p>That's why we've open-sourced a piece of the magic behind GitHub for Mac: ReactiveCocoa (RAC).</p>

      <p>Core Audio is a set of services that developers use to implement audio and music features in Mac and iOS apps.
