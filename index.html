      <h4>ReactiveCocoa</h4>
      <p>Native apps spend a lot of time waiting and then reacting. We wait for the user to do something in the UI. Wait for a network call to respond. Wait for an asynchronous operation to complete. Wait for some dependent value to change. And then they react.</p>
      <p>But all those things—all that waiting and reacting—is usually handled in many disparate ways. That makes it hard for us to reason about them, chain them, or compose them in any uniform, high-level way. We can do better.</p>
      <p>That's why we've open-sourced a piece of the magic behind GitHub for Mac: ReactiveCocoa (RAC).</p>

      <h4>Core Audio</h4>
      <p>Core Audio is the most comprehensive and powerful audio programming framework ever created and it's built into OS X and iOS.  In this talk we'll explore this low-level C-based world and take a look at the technologies that power apps like GarageBand and Logic.  We'll also delve into some of the APIs in more detail to see how, where and when they can be used.</p>

      <h4>Code Coverage on iOS</h4>
      <p>Code coverage reports can be invaluable for identifying untested code. However, like all metrics, percentage coverage makes a good servant but a bad master. Moreover getting a coverage report from an iOS simulator or device can require some surprising and poorly documented workarounds.</p>
      <p>We will identify good and bad ways to use code coverage reports and provide the full recipe for getting them working using Xcode, iOS and Jenkins.</p>

      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p>Richard is a freelance iOS and Mac consultant and the founder of Sailmaker Systems Ltd. He has been programming on Apple hardware since the days of Macintosh System 6.</p>

    <div class="biography">
      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p>When Quinn joined a large Silicon Valley computer company, more than 15 years ago now, he was instantly labelled as The Network Guy&trade; and he's been trying to shake that epithet ever since.  In reality he helps people with a wide range of low level technologies, including file systems, threads, memory, IPC and &hellip; yes &hellip; networking.</p>
