<p>OK.</p>

<p>It's *very* rough and ready, and a fancier website will follow soon... but it's working.  Here's what you need to do.</p>

<p><i>After 10am on Thursday March 3rd</i>, you can register for a ticket at the EventWax URL below.</p>

<ul>
<li>I only need your name and email address, you can ignore the other (non-compulsory) fields.</li>
<li>Please click/read the Terms and Conditions link at the end of the booking process.</li>
<li><strong>TL;DR - NO REFUNDS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE CASH GOES STRAIGHT TO CHARITY</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Go to <a href="http://developersagainstpoverty.org/">Developers Against Poverty</a> and make a $80 (Â£50) donation per ticket. Ideally, mention NSScotland in the comments field.</p>

<p>Scotty informs me the DAP campaign is only running until March 31st.  If there are still tickets available by then, I'll close registration, change the instructions to making a donation to <a href="http://chas.org.uk/">the Childrens Hospice</a> and reopen.</p>

<p>The speakers, if you haven't been following on Twitter, are:</p>

<p>From @MacMacDev:  <a href="http://instinctivecode.com">Matt Gemmell</a>, <a href="http://connectedflow.com">Fraser Speirs</a>, <a href="http://www.pcalc.com/">James Thomson</a>, <a href="http://openplanetsoftware.com">Gavin McLean</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/hatfinch">Hamish Allan</a></p>
<p>Token Englishman: <a href="http://securemacprogramming.com">Graham Lee</a></p>

<p>One other to be confirmed once he's been blessed by his overlords, not sure I'm allowed to say yet, so I won't.</p>

<p>Schedule will likely be 40 minute talk, 20 minute break, rinse repeat with an hour break for lunch.  9-5, or possibly 10-6 depending on how we all feel closer to the time.</p>

<p>What else...</p>

<p>My friendly local Starbucks manager has informed me she'll lay on free coffee and snacks for us, and lunch is likely to be Papa Johns Pizza which is going to be delivered courtesy of Matt Farrugia at <a href="http://bitwink.com/">BitWink</a>  Thanks <a href="http://bitwink.com/">BitWink</a>!.</p>

<p>OK, the registration URL is <a href="https://nsscotland.eventwax.com/nsscotland-2011/register">https://nsscotland.eventwax.com/nsscotland-2011/register</a></p>

<p>I hope you all can make it. Thanks for bearing with me through this crazy experiment.</p>

<p>Alan</p>
