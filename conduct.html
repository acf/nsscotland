    </div>
    <div class="large-10 columns strap-text large-centered">
      <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
      <p><strong>tl;dr: Be excellent with each other</strong></p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">The Quick Version</h3>
		<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a welcoming conference experience for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form (this includes the content of speakers presentations). Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">The Less Quick Version</h3>

		<p>If you are being made to feel uncomfortable, or notice that someone else in that situation, or have any other concerns <strong>at all</strong>, please contact <strong>Alan</strong> immediately.  He's the guy at the front between the sessions.</p>

		<p>Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

		<p>If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

		<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

		<p>We'd hope that participants would follow these rules at all times, but we'll enforce them at conference, the workshops and conference-related social events.</p>
