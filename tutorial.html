      <p><img src="/images/2013/Apple_Swift_Logo.png" />Exact content is still being worked out, and will evolve as Swift approaches 1.0, 
      but the tutorial will involve an introduction to the Swift language and using it to build iOS applications.  It will act as a companion to 
      <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/a-swift-kickstart/id891801923?mt=11">the Swift Kickstart book</a>.</p>

        <h3>Daniel Steinberg</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://dimsumthinking.com/">Dim Sum Thinking</a></h4>
        <p>Daniel Steinberg has spent the last three decades programming the iPad and iPhone. OK, he hasn't. But he's been programming the iPhone and the iPad since the SDK's first appeared in beta and Mac OS X for many years before. Daniel is the author of the book <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/ipad-iphone-app-development/id572052683?ls=1">iPad and iPhone App Development</a>, the official companion book to the popular iTunes U series from Stanford University.</p>
        <p>Daniel presents iPhone and Cocoa training for the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ios">Pragmatic Studio</a> and consults through his company Dim Sum Thinking. When he's not coding or talking about coding for the Mac, the iPhone, and the iPad he's probably cooking or hanging out with his wife and daughter.</p>
