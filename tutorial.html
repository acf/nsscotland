      <h3><strong>iOS Quickstart</strong> with <a href="#" data-reveal-id="daniel-steinberg">Daniel Steinberg</a></h3>
      <p><img src="/images/2013/ios.jpg" />Now it’s even easier than ever to start writing apps for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. The development tools are free; there is a wealth of books, screencasts, and other support materials; and many of the obstacles to getting started have now been removed.</p>
      <p>iOS5 changed the way we write apps for our favorite mobile devices with Automatic Reference Counting and Storyboards. iOS6 included changes to the way we write Objective-C as well as Automatic Layout. By the time of this workshop we expect iOS7 to have publicly shipped along with its improvements and enhancements.</p>
      <h4>What's covered?</h4>
      <p>You’ll learn about Xcode and the other developer tools that Apple provides for free through the Mac App store. You’ll learn to write your code using Objective-C, the language of iOS development, and to design your interfaces using a GUI tool that is now part of Xcode. We’ll focus on the central role of View Controllers and work on an extended example of storyboarding that involves many different scenes.</p>

      <h4>Who should come?</h4>
      <p>This workshop is for developers at all levels who want to write apps for the iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. In one day you’ll be introduced to the four fundamental areas of iOS development: Xcode, Objective-C, View Controllers, and Storyboards. After that, all you’ll need is an idea for your own app and some time to develop it. Attendees should be familiar with a C-style language and with Object Oriented Programming in some language.</p>
      <h4>Preparation</h4>
      <p>This is a hands-on tutorial so you'll need a Mac laptop and Apple's Xcode developer tools.</p>
      <p>The workshop will use the currently shipping public version of Xcode.</p>
      <p>As of now, any intel Mac will do (MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air), and you'll need at least 10.7 Lion, but for best results, and to guard against any future Xcode requirements,  we recommend you be running 10.8 - Mountain Lion.  This is available to anyone running 10.6.8+ on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/os-x-mountain-lion/id537386512?mt=12">Mac App Store</a> for £13.99.</p>
      <p>Of course, if the next version of Xcode requires 10.8 (or even 10.9!) you'll need to be running that.</p>
      <p>Xcode is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">available on the Mac App Store</a> for free.  It's likely that by October a new version of Xcode will be available supporting iOS7, but installing now will allow the Mac App Store to update you as and when the software is released.</p>
      <p>There's no exam, or individual assessment, so feel free to work in pairs round a single laptop if you'd prefer.</p>

        <h3>Daniel Steinberg</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://dimsumthinking.com/">Dim Sum Thinking</a></h4>
        <p>Daniel Steinberg has spent the last three decades programming the iPad and iPhone. OK, he hasn't. But he's been programming the iPhone and the iPad since the SDK's first appeared in beta and Mac OS X for many years before. Daniel is the author of the book <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/ipad-iphone-app-development/id572052683?ls=1">iPad and iPhone App Development</a>, the official companion book to the popular iTunes U series from Stanford University.</p>
        <p>Daniel presents iPhone and Cocoa training for the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ios">Pragmatic Studio</a> and consults through his company Dim Sum Thinking. When he's not coding or talking about coding for the Mac, the iPhone, and the iPad he's probably cooking or hanging out with his wife and daughter.</p>
