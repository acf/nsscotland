<h2>Tickets</h2>

<p>In 2011 I was able to secure a free venue, and <a href="http://bitwink.com">BitWink</a> were kind enough to pay for lunch. There were no costs associated with the conference at all, so the ticket price was just an opportunity to raise some money for charity.</p>

<p>This year, with the larger size and expected larger numbers, I'm in a venue that costs real money for both space and food. That means that the ticket prices are higher than 2011.</p>

<p>I'm delighted to say, however, that I've still been able to keep everything as tight as possible and the tickets are only <strong>£199</strong> for the two-day conference or <strong>£259</strong> for the conference and the Daniel Steinberg iOS tutorial (there's no VAT) .

<p>Just like in 2011, your ticket price <b>includes</b> lunches, but <b>does not include</b> accommodation or travel.  I'm hoping to arrange dinner on the Saturday night, but this will very much depend on numbers.</p>

<p>For accomodation, we recommend <a href="http://www.laterooms.com/en/Hotels.aspx?k=EH16%205AY&d=20131018&n=3&rt=1-0">late rooms</a>, which lists a wide range of options for hotel and self-catering accomodation.</p>
