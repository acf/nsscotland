<h2>Tickets</h2>

<p class="bigger">OK.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to do.</p>

<p>There are a few additional tickets remaining.  You can register for a ticket at the EventWax URL below.</p>

<ul>
<li>I only need your name and email address, you can ignore the other (non-compulsory) fields.</li>
<li>Please click/read the Terms and Conditions link at the end of the booking process.</li>
<li><strong>TL;DR - NO REFUNDS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE CASH GOES STRAIGHT TO CHARITY</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Go to <a href="http://chas.org.uk/donate.html">The Childrens Hospice Association</a> and make a Â£50 donation per ticket. Ideally, mention NSScotland in the company name.</p>
