      <p>For the first NSScotland in 2011 we able to secure a free venue, and <a href="http://bitwink.com">BitWink</a> were kind enough to pay for lunch. 
      There were no costs associated with the conference at all, so the ticket price was just an opportunity to raise some money for charity.</p>

      <p>This year, with the larger size and expected larger numbers, We're in a venue that costs real money for both space and food. That means that the ticket prices are higher than 2011.</p>

      <p>However, we're delighted to say that tickets are only <strong>£199</strong> for the two-day conference or <strong>£259</strong> for 
      the conference and <a href="tutorial.html">a choice of tutorial</a> (there's no VAT).</p>

      <p>Just like in 2011, your ticket price <strong>includes</strong> lunches, but <strong>does not include</strong> accommodation or travel.  We hope to 
      arrange dinner on the Saturday night, but this will very much depend on numbers.</p>

      <p>For accomodation, we recommend <a href="http://www.laterooms.com/en/Hotels.aspx?k=EH16%205AY&d=20131018&n=3&rt=1-0">late rooms</a>, which lists a wide range of options for hotel and self-catering accomodation.  There's also accomodation available at <a href="http://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/for-accommodation">the venue itself</a>.</p>
