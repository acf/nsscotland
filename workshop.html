      <h3><strong>Thinking in Swift</strong> <br/> with <a href="#" data-reveal-id="daniel-steinberg">Daniel Steinberg</a></h3>
      
      <p><img src="/images/2013/Apple_Swift_Logo.png" />You’ve learned the fundamentals of Swift syntax, but you’re still thinking in 
      your native language. You’re writing Objective-C, Java, C#, … code in Swift. <br/><br/>
		This fast-paced workshop shows you how to take advantage of Swift features to write more robust code that is easier to reason
		 about. We’ll spend a good part of the day looking at functional programming and playing with map, filter, reduce, and flatmap 
		 but we will also create instances of classes, structs, and enums.<br/><br/>
		One of the strengths of Swift is that it can borrow the best from
		 a multitude of paradigms. We’ll look at how to succesfully weave together 
		 OO and functional code into a readable and flexible architecture.<br/><br/>
		We assume that you are an experienced programmer who has spent some time looking at Swift but you aren’t yet an expert 
		in Swift. You understand most of the hows and whats of working with Swift and are looking for the whys and wheres.<br/><br/>
		If you liked last year’s workshop, you’re going to love the one we have planned for you this year! And if you didn’t attend 
		last year’s, take some time to acquaint yourself with Swift Syntax (we know a good book!) and join us for a day of Thinking in Swift.</p>

        <h3>Daniel Steinberg</h3>
        <h4><a href="http://dimsumthinking.com/">Dim Sum Thinking</a></h4>
        <p>Daniel Steinberg has spent the last three decades programming the iPad and iPhone. OK, he hasn't. But he's been programming the iPhone and the iPad since the SDK's first appeared in beta and Mac OS X for many years before. Daniel is the author of the book <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/ipad-iphone-app-development/id572052683?ls=1">iPad and iPhone App Development</a>, the official companion book to the popular iTunes U series from Stanford University.</p>
        <p>Daniel presents iPhone and Cocoa training for the <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ios">Pragmatic Studio</a> and consults through his company Dim Sum Thinking. When he's not coding or talking about coding for the Mac, the iPhone, and the iPad he's probably cooking or hanging out with his wife and daughter.</p>
