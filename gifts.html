      <p>My friend Simon Wolf spoke last year at the conference, but was unable to make it this year.  
      He was keen to support the conference in some other way and suggested he buy a ticket which we 
      could use to allow someone else to attend.  Someone who might not be able to afford it.</p>
      
      <p>Our cash flow is extremely tight this year, which means we're constrained in 
      our ability to offer cheap tickets to (for example) students, or free tickets for people 
      who require assistance and need to bring someone with them.<p/>
      
      <p>Simon's purchase has been used to allow a programmer to overcome some obstacles and attend.</p>
      
      <p><strong>We decided to formalise this idea of gifting tickets</br/>to allow others to follow Simon's lead.</strong></p>
      
      <p>When you click through to <a href="https://ti.to/nsscotland/2014/">tito.io</a> to buy a ticket, you can select a "gift ticket".  Fill in your 
      own details so we can tell the recipient who to thank.  We can change the details later to match the attendee.</p>
      
      <p>Whether you're an individual who cant make it but is happy to support a student, or an 
      organisation looking for an interesting way to sponsor the conference, please consider 
      buying a gift ticket (or tickets) for someone.</p>
